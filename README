OpenGL-Modern version 0.01_01
=============================

This is an *alpha* release for OpenGL API bindings for versions
from 3.1 to 4.5.  Bindings have been generated for all API
routines but any pointer value arguments or return values are
implemented as passing and returning appropriate perl strings.

See documentation and the source for OpenGL::Modern::Helpers
for examples for calling those routines.  The implementation
for those arguments *will* be changing and will be documented
in OpenGL::Modern::Helpers in lib/OpenGl/Modern/Helpers.pm .

All releases for OpenGL::Modern *will* be *alpha* until the
API is fully implemented and stabilized.  We're happy for
use and feedback and questions.  See #pogl on irc.perl.org
for chatting and the Perl OpenGL users lists at the sf.net
site.  They are members only but you can use the Subscribe
link to join:
